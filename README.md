# Minesweeper Project - Multimedia Technology 2023

## Description

This Minesweeper project was developed as part of the Multimedia Technology course in 2023. The goal was to create a unique version of Minesweeper using **JavaFX**, incorporating the following features:

- **Hyper Bomb:** Introduces a bomb with a distinct functionality. If flagged within the first 4 moves (right or left click), it reveals the entire row and column of the hyper bomb tile.

- **Countdown Timer:** Includes a countdown timer to track the time available for the player to win the game. 

- **Custom Game Versions:** Allows users to create and load their own versions of the game, with customizable parameters such as the number of bombs, time limit, presence of a hyper bomb, and the size of the game frame (number of tiles).
